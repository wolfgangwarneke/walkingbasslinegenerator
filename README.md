# Walking Bassline Generator

Generate walking basslines for chord progression.

## Project Outline

This project is projected to be completed in four stages:
- musical grammar types and functional helpers
- stylistic randomization and composition of basslines
- user interface
- demo audio synthesis

Current status: first stage - Building-block helpers are in complete for basic note systems and relation to the bass instrument range. A messy implentation which outputs triads over a 12-bar blues has been achieved, but will need to be redesigned.
